## Agent Flow System
The project now includes a 5-agent workflow for feature development:
1. **Planning** - Initial analysis and planning
2. **Review** - Validation and quality checks  
3. **Discovery** - Technical research
4. **Execution** - Implementation
5. **Complete** - Final documentation

Key benefits: 
- Parallel development setup allows stable reference (port 3000) while actively developing (port 3001)
- Individual task files prevent status-details.md bloat and improve organization
- Each task has its own file for easy discovery and management

## Next Steps
- **Ready for portfolio development**: Use @1-design-planning.md to start first feature
- Customize portfolio content (About, Projects, etc.)
- Replace placeholder images with actual work
- Set up deployment pipeline (Vercel/Netlify)
- Test the design agents workflow with real features

## Repositories Status
- ✅ **zebra-design**: Portfolio project ready for development
- ✅ **ai-vibe-design-code**: Standalone design system ready for sharing/import

## Tech Stack
- Next.js v15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4.1
- TypeScript v5.8
- MDX for blog posts
- React v19

### Notes:
- Removed outdated next-six-weeks.md from consideration
- Aligned all tasks with three-funnel architecture strategy
- Prioritized sustainable building over rush to revenue
- Newsletter CTA justified by: technical founders do 70-95% research before contact, authority leads convert 3-5x higher, only need 4-6 clients/year
- Hidden inquiry page handles sales conversations when prospects are ready (demand-side approach)
- Added cal.com link in footer as subtle "escape valve" for ready-now prospects
- Website broken into staged releases: MVP today → incremental enhancements throughout sprint

### Website Staging Strategy:
- **Day 1 (TODAY)**: Hero, case study images, newsletter CTA, cal.com footer
- **Day 3-4**: Add credibility section (Deep Work, metrics)
- **Day 5-6**: Add services section (three tiers)
- **Day 7-8**: Add full Animatix case study
- **Day 9-10**: Add process section

This allows immediate launch while maintaining quality for each section.

### Website Copy Validation (Oct 1, 2025):
Reviewed existing website draft against business plan - copy is well-aligned:
- ✓ "UX + Code. Fast." perfectly addresses ICP pain points
- ✓ "Your code → Beautiful UX" clear transformation promise
- ✓ Transparent pricing (€25k, 3 weeks) matches Tier 2 positioning
- ✓ Strong social proof with recognizable client logos
- **Critical addition needed**: Newsletter CTA for three-funnel architecture
- **Minor clarification**: Reconcile "1 week per feature" vs "3 weeks" messaging
- **Enhancement opportunity**: Add subtle "70% problem" reference

### Website Copy Revision (Oct 1, 2025 - Later):
- Removed salesy/marketing language per user feedback
- Rewrote to authentic, developer-friendly tone:
  - "I Build UX Tools and Share What Works" (not "See How I Fix...")
  - Direct explanation of 70% problem without hype
  - Simple CTAs: "Get the Newsletter" and "Weekly Newsletter"
  - Footer: "Working on something?" instead of "Need help right now?"
- Matches anti-promotional approach from three-funnel architecture
- Added proper attribution for "70% problem" to Addy Osmani with links
- Included relevant statistics: 25% of YC batch with 95% AI code, 66% developer frustration
- Links provide authority and show it's an industry-recognized issue

### Critical Insight (Oct 1, 2025 - Later):
- Realized "70% problem" article conflates hobbyists (Bolt/Lovable) with serious technical founders (Cursor/v0)
- Our ICP targets technical founders using AI for speed, NOT hobbyists who can't code
- Reframed from "70% problem" to "Speed vs Polish" - technical teams skip UX when shipping fast
- Focus on business metrics (30% activation, 8% churn) not coding ability
- Core strategy remains sound - we fix UX for teams moving at AI speed

### Website Copy Simplification (Oct 1, 2025 - Final):
- Stripped copy to absolute essentials per user feedback
- Newsletter: "Weekly UX Experiments" + "Subscribe" (4 words total)
- Reality section: 4 short sentences, no fluff
- Total copy under 50 words for main sections
- Maximum clarity, zero sales language

### Website Copy Final Version (Oct 1, 2025):
- User personalized copy further
- Single consolidated newsletter section: "Weekly UX + Code Experiments"
- Button: "AI UX Design on Substack in your inbox" (more descriptive)
- Removed separate "Reality" section
- Added sub-text explaining the value prop in personal voice
- Fixed typos: "You're" not "Your", "latest" not "last"
