# Project Status - Zebra Design Portfolio

## Current Status
- **Date**: September 20, 2025
- **Phase**: Initial setup complete ✅
- **Last Updated**: Integrated design agents flow system
- **Repository**: https://github.com/charlieellington/zebra-design

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Set up Spotlight template with all dependencies
- ✅ Created git repository and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Added design agents flow system from previous project
- ✅ Updated PARALLEL-DEV-SETUP.md for zebra-design context
- ✅ Simplified agents flow (removed Agent 0, extra documentation)
- ✅ Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with security rules and "never edit" directive
- ✅ **MAJOR**: Restructured agents to use individual task files instead of status-details.md
  - Created `doing/` folder for tasks in progress
  - Created `done/` folder for completed tasks
  - Updated all 5 design agent files to use new structure
  - Agent 5 now moves files from `doing/` to `done/` when complete
- ✅ **Updated rule files for project context**:
  - `tailwind_rules.mdc`: Adapted from Animatix context to zebra-design portfolio standards
  - `shadcn_rules.mdc`: Marked as reference-only since project uses Headless UI
  - Updated design agents to reference appropriate rules (Agent 1, 3 & 4)
- ✅ **Renamed agent files for easier tagging**:
  - `design-1-planning.md` → `1-design-planning.md`
  - `design-2-review.md` → `2-design-review.md`
  - `design-3-discovery.md` → `3-design-discovery.md`
  - `design-4-execution.md` → `4-design-execution.md`
  - `design-5-complete.md` → `5-design-complete.md`
- ✅ **Updated MCP tool references to match actual available tools**:
  - Fixed shadcn_rules.mdc to reference correct MCP tool names
  - Updated 3-design-discovery.md with actual MCP tool commands
- ✅ **Generalized PARALLEL-DEV-SETUP.md for any project**:
  - Added variable placeholders ({PROJECT_NAME}, {GITHUB_URL}, {BRANCH_NAME})
  - Included specific examples for zebra-design
  - Updated troubleshooting to be project-agnostic
  - Added project-specific quick reference section
- ✅ **Cleaned up all legacy project references**:
  - Removed remaining Animatix references from shadcn_rules.mdc
  - Updated 1-design-planning.md to be project-agnostic
  - Documentation is now clean and ready for sharing
- ✅ **Created comprehensive documentation README**:
  - Moved design-agents-readme.md to documentation/README.md
  - Updated to explain entire documentation system and design-forward process
  - Added instructions for importing into any Next.js project
  - Included technology stack information and adaptation guidelines
- ✅ **Made PARALLEL-DEV-SETUP.md truly universal**:
  - Added support for all package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
  - Added multi-framework support (Next.js, Vite, CRA, Remix, etc.)
  - Created auto-detection script for package manager and framework
  - Added comprehensive environment variable handling
  - Enhanced troubleshooting for cross-project issues
  - Created executable setup-parallel-dev.sh script for one-command setup
- ✅ **Added comprehensive Obsidian kanban integration**:
  - Updated status.md with detailed Obsidian setup instructions
  - Added explanation of why visual kanban management is essential
  - Documented the synergy between parallel development and visual workflow
  - Included both basic and advanced Obsidian features guide
  - Updated main README.md with complete Obsidian integration section

## Agent Flow System
The project now includes a 5-agent workflow for feature development:
1. **Planning** - Initial analysis and planning
2. **Review** - Validation and quality checks  
3. **Discovery** - Technical research
4. **Execution** - Implementation
5. **Complete** - Final documentation

Key benefits: 
- Parallel development setup allows stable reference (port 3000) while actively developing (port 3001)
- Individual task files prevent status-details.md bloat and improve organization
- Each task has its own file for easy discovery and management

## Next Steps
- Customize portfolio content (About, Projects, etc.)
- Replace placeholder images with actual work
- Set up deployment pipeline
- Implement first feature using agents flow

## Tech Stack
- Next.js v15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4.1
- TypeScript v5.8
- MDX for blog posts
- React v19
