# Project Scratchpad

## Current Status: October 1, 2025

### Epic: Pre-Paternity Leave Authority Foundation

**Status Update - Wednesday, October 1, 2025**
- Populated kanban board with three-funnel architecture implementation tasks
- Organized using MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- First sprint focuses on MVP funnel foundation: website + newsletter
- Clear path from current state to sustainable authority-based pipeline

### Sprint 1 (Next 2 Weeks) Deliverables:
1. MVP website launched TODAY (hero + case study images + newsletter CTA + cal.com footer)
2. Substack newsletter launched ("UX for Technical Minds")
3. Website incrementally enhanced (credibility → services → case studies → process)
4. First Idea → Build → Test cycle completed
5. Animatix case study documented and added to site
6. €3k/month retainer secured
7. Basic email capture system operational
8. Week 1 content published
9. Network reconnection emails sent

### Key Decisions Made:
- Starting with Client Attraction funnel (top of funnel)
- Using Substack as primary newsletter platform
- Focus on building in public with weekly rhythm
- No complex automation until content proves itself
- Authority-based approach over sales-focused
- Website CTA is newsletter signup, NOT sales calls (builds trust with technical founders)
- Hidden inquiry page strategy for when prospects self-select readiness

### Next Actions After Sprint 1:
- Move "Must" items into Sprint 2
- Begin confidence funnel development
- Launch first tool (70% Problem Analyzer)
- Host first workshop

### Notes:
- Removed outdated next-six-weeks.md from consideration
- Aligned all tasks with three-funnel architecture strategy
- Prioritized sustainable building over rush to revenue
- Newsletter CTA justified by: technical founders do 70-95% research before contact, authority leads convert 3-5x higher, only need 4-6 clients/year
- Hidden inquiry page handles sales conversations when prospects are ready (demand-side approach)
- Added cal.com link in footer as subtle "escape valve" for ready-now prospects
- Website broken into staged releases: MVP today → incremental enhancements throughout sprint

### Website Staging Strategy:
- **Day 1 (TODAY)**: Hero, case study images, newsletter CTA, cal.com footer
- **Day 3-4**: Add credibility section (Deep Work, metrics)
- **Day 5-6**: Add services section (three tiers)
- **Day 7-8**: Add full Animatix case study
- **Day 9-10**: Add process section

This allows immediate launch while maintaining quality for each section.
