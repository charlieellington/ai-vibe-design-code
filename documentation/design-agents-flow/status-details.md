# DEPRECATED: Individual Task Files Used Instead

**NOTE**: This file is no longer used. The agents flow now uses individual task files for better organization:

- **Active tasks**: `doing/[task-slug].md`
- **Completed tasks**: `done/[task-slug].md`

See `../README.md` for details on the new structure.
